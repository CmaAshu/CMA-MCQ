                correctAnswerCode: 2 // Corrected: Total runs = 10+20+9 = 39. Cost per run = 73000/39 = 1871.79. For B (20 runs) = 20 * 1871.79 = 37435. Closest option is 40,000. Original PDF answer '2' (40,000) suggests the inspection cost might have been 78,000 (78000/39 * 20 = 40000). Assuming PDF answer is based on a different total cost or a typo in the question. With 73,000, none of the options are very close. Let's recalculate based on PDF answer: If for B it's 40,000 for 20 runs, then cost per run is 2000. Total cost = 2000 * 39 = 78,000. So the question likely had 78,000 as inspection cost. I will stick to the provided PDF answer code.
