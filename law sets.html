So 1/3rd of the rotational ones. The question is "of the total number of directors". This implies 2/3rd are liable to retire, and 1/3rd of *those* retire. So 1/3 of 2/3 = 2/9. However, options are direct fractions. If it means 1/3 of total, that's also a common misinterpretation. The most common interpretation of such phrasing is 1/3rd of the rotational pool. Original data had 2 (Two third). Let's assume "not less than 1/3 of total directors shall be rotational, and 1/3 of these rotational directors retire". This is complex for MCQ. If the question implies "what fraction of total directors retire", it's tricky. Sticking with original 2 (Two-thirds are liable to retire by rotation).
